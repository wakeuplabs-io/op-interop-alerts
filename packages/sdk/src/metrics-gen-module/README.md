# Metrics Generation Module

The Metrics Generation Module is a service designed to consume data from the tracking module and transform it into actionable insights for cross-chain messaging operations.

## Overview

This module filters relevant information from raw tracking data and generates structured outputs to provide operational intelligence for cross-chain communication monitoring.

## Key Features

### 1. Interop Status Information

- **Real-time visibility** into cross-chain messaging states (active, degraded, or down)
- **Message delivery monitoring** highlighting delays versus on-time arrivals
- **Performance tracking** across different chain pairs

### 2. Core Metrics

- **Latency measurement** between chains to evaluate message propagation speed
- **Gas usage analysis** on both sender and receiver sides
- **Throughput calculations** for message volume assessment
- **Timing metrics** for delivery performance evaluation

### 3. Health Alerts

- **Event verification** to ensure expected events are properly delivered
- **Alert generation** for operational issues requiring attention

## Purpose

The Metrics Generation Module establishes a reliable metrics layer that converts raw tracking data into meaningful operational intelligence. This enables:

- **Better monitoring** of cross-chain operations
- **Increased transparency** in message delivery processes
- **Faster troubleshooting** of cross-chain communication issues
- **Proactive identification** of potential problems
